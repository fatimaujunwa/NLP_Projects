## üìä Evaluation Results

As part of my participation in the **Location Mention Recognition (LMR) Challenge**, I worked on developing a system to automatically recognize and extract location mentions from microblogging posts during disaster scenarios. My approach involved leveraging advanced NLP techniques, data preprocessing strategies, and iterative model improvements to enhance the performance of the system.

### üèÜ Final Results

After extensive experimentation and optimization, I achieved the following results:

- **Public Leaderboard Score:** `0.2511`
- **Private Leaderboard Score:** `0.2494`

These scores represent the **Word Error Rate (WER)**, which measures the accuracy of the model in detecting location mentions compared to the ground truth. A lower score indicates better performance.

### üîç Approach and Key Insights

Throughout this challenge, I explored various techniques and strategies to improve the model's performance, including:

1. **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:**  
   - Tokenization and normalization of microblogging text.
   - Handling abbreviations, misspellings, and informal language.

2. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Incorporating contextual embeddings using transformer-based models like BERT.
   - Fine-tuning Named Entity Recognition (NER) models on disaster-related datasets.

3. **Model Selection & Optimization:**  
   - Comparing traditional approaches (CRFs, spaCy) vs. deep learning methods.
   - Hyperparameter tuning to balance precision and recall.

4. **Post-processing Strategies:**  
   - Refining predictions through rule-based corrections and ensemble methods.
   - Ensuring proper ordering of multiple location mentions in the output.
